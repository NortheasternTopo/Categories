  <h1>ART AND SPIN</h1>
  <h3>Music and lyrics by Clarice DuVall & Jimmy “Buzz” McCallister</h3>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Well now...<br>
    You say “design,” I say “art”<br>
    They say “obey,” and I say “depart!”<br>
    We all look on, but not the same—<br>
    The work is often defined by its frame...</p>

    <p>Is it art, craft, propaganda or design?<br>
    Is yours the right answer, or is it mine?<br>
    The question to ask again and again:<br>
    Is it freeing your heart—or tightening the chain?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Art stirs the soul with a whisper of doubt,<br>
    Design shines a light, helps you find a way out.<br>
    Propaganda shouts with a chest full of pride—<br>
    "We know what’s better! It is us who decide!"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Art wants you free, with your mind on a flight,<br>
    Design wants you comfy, the couch just feels right.<br>
    Propaganda is fueled by fear and by blame<br>
    “Want to be safe? Throw a book to the flame!”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>From cathedrals to canvas, to code in a screen,<br>
    What we see isn't always what’s seen.<br>
    That chapel? Divine! Or an altar to spin?<br>
    Depends on who’s praying, depends on who wins?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Art takes a stand, gives the voiceless a voice,<br>
    Design smooths the ride, gives the user a choice.<br>
    But propaganda pounds like a drum in the night—<br>
    “March to the tune, don’t question what’s right!”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>So next time you’re dazzled by media, so fine.<br>
    Ask: Who penned the slogan? Who drew the line?<br>
    And these parting words—I’ll sing with a grin:<br>
    Even this little tune...<br>
    Could be art, could be spin.</p>
  </div>
